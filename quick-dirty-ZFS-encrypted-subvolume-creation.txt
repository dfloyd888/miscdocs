Note, this is how one creates a ZFS subvolume that is decrypted automatically... assuming / is encrypted.

First, create a keyfile:

mkdir /root/keys
openssl rand -out /root/keys/keyfile.dat 32

Second, create the ZFS pool.

To add, type in :

zfs create -o encryption=on -o keyformat=raw -o keylocation=-file:///root/keys/enc.dat pool/subvolume

-----

If it doesn't mount, type in

zfs loadkey -a

zfs mount -a
